# SingleCellNotes

## General
* [awesome-single-cell](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell): List of software packages (and the people developing these methods) for single-cell data analysis, including RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.
* [scRNA-tools](https://www.scrna-tools.org/): A catalogue of tools for analysing single-cell RNA sequencing data
* A curated [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1En7-UV0k0laDiIfjFkdn7dggyR7jIk3WH8QgXaMOZF0/edit#gid=0) of of single-cell transcriptomics studies.


## Trajectory inference

* [single-cell-pseudotime](https://github.com/agitter/single-cell-pseudotime): Overview of single-cell RNA-seq pseudotime estimation algorithms.
* [dynmethods](https://github.com/dynverse/dynmethods): A collection of 55 trajectory inference methods. To run any of these methods, interpret the results and visualise the trajectory, see the [dyno](https://github.com/dynverse/dyno) package.
